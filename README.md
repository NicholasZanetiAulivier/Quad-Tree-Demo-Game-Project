## Quad Tree Demo Game Project

Welcome to our repository. As written in the title, this repository is created for the sole purpose of doing version control throught out our development of a basic game project made in Java. All of the classes imported and used in our project come from the Java API, which means they're very basic and probably really slow. But this is more of a constraint than a challenge. As this is a college project, the assets and techniques used will be very basic and all that matters in the end is that we understand every part of it.

We have chosen to make a Quad Tree Space Partitioning Mechanism as our project, implementing it as the Broad Phase algorithm for our collision detection mechanism. At this current moment, we are unsure of how it'll turn out. Hopefully, by the end, this repository will be an archive of our successful game project.

## Engine

The "Game Engine" will be made entirely in Java, without any imported libraries outside of the Java API, meaning no GPU acceleration, 3D, or shaders will be supported. As of the current commit, the engine is able to support "Scenes" not unlike Godot, and the main loop is based on a popular Game Engine called [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org/). Since we're the only ones using this engine, support for anything beyond what has been mentioned is very limited.

## TO DO

An animation mechanism needs to be added for basic animations. We need to make an actual game for the actual project. Deadline is June 2025, good luck to us all
